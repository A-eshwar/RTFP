❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
🩺 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the early stages of heart disease by utilizing machine learning models trained on clinical data. Unlike traditional binary risk tools, our system provides a personalized, probability-based risk score, helping individuals understand their cardiovascular health more accurately.

⚡ Achieved an overall accuracy of 94% with the implemented ML models.

📌 Features
Predicts heart disease risk based on clinical parameters
Provides a percentage-based probability instead of simple Yes/No results
Built using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Stacking models
Easy-to-use interface powered by Gradio
Uses the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset
Focused on early detection and personalized healthcare

🔍 Problem Statement
Traditional heart disease prediction tools are often outdated, offer limited input options, and provide only binary outputs. This project addresses the lack of accessible, real-time, data-driven prediction systems by providing an interactive, intelligent model that supports proactive health decisions.

💡 Proposed Solution
Accepts clinical input parameters like:
Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol
Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG Results, Max Heart Rate, Angina, ST Depression
Slope of ST Segment, Number of Major Vessels, Thalassemia type
Returns a risk probability (%) for heart disease
Offers a visual and intuitive Gradio interface
Employs preprocessing, feature selection, and ensemble learning techniques

📊 Results
The system predicted heart disease risk with a high degree of accuracy.
Provides risk levels like: "High Risk of Heart Disease with 73.06% confidence".
Average prediction accuracy across all models: 94%
